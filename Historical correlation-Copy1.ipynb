    "As you can verify by hovering above the heatmap, the 0.84 overall correlation corresponds to the lower-right pixel, i.e., the correlation between 1998 and recently. If you published a heatmap like this in a newsletter, the first one would be the part of the triangle with the x axis (window end date) equal to the date then. Over the years you'd get successively larger and larger triangles as you moved to the right of the x axis.\n",

    "1. The dark triangle in the lower-left corresponds to the period of low-ish correlation between SPY and XLF daily returns during the Tech Bubble popping.\n",
    "1. From roughly mid-2000 to mid-2008, SPY and XLF daily returns were very highly correlated. All time horizons that started and ended within this band saw correlation of roughly 0.9. This is the band of yellow in the lower-left (and to the right of the darker wedge). The transition between the Tech Bubble to this period is quite obvious in this graph.\n",
    "1. However, another major transition is quite visible starting around September 2008. Recall that September to October 2008 saw a trapdoor open under SPY, when it lost roughly 30% in a month (after it was around 20% off the 2007 October peak; sorry my Plotly skills aren't advanced enough to give you an interactive percent-change version of the first plot above to verify this right now). This means that every time horizon that began before the September 2008 inflection point and ended after it falls in that big rectangle of smooth green, of correlation roughly 0.85, which time horizons fully on either side of this inflection point have more opportunity to vary from 0.85. To understand this, scroll back up to the scatter plot of daily percent changes and note how all the dots that ring the central line, like a halo, are from this mid-2008 period. Those deviations from linearity form an envelope inside which all other points lie, and so the correlation over any time horizon that includes that halo is forced to be close to 0.85.\n",
    "1. Other bands, both vertical and horizontal, are visible in the data after the Great Financial Crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully this tutorial offers the basics of using correlation to break down two time series. The statistics and signal processing of such data is very rich, so there are many, many more directions you can take such analysis.\n",
